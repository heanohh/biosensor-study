**S.E.M. Activities and Creations (when? 2022-1)**
</br>
I studied about drug delivery's mathmetical models: Higuchi model, Korsemeyer-Peppas release model, and Weibull model. And also, a typical high-sensitive enzyme biosensor's kinetic model.
These models are studied when I was in Ewha Womans University's math club, S.E.M. by reading and analyzing the journals.

**SPARK Activities and Creations (when? 2021-2~2022-2)**
</br>
I read about various biosensors' journals and analyzed and questioned about them. After that, I wrote the posters about that journal and made a presentation (a poster session). The biosensors were: Immunosensor IL13Ra2, magnetonanosensor, RNA toll like receptors. 
</br>

ESPECIALLY about drug delivery, I read various journals, sorted them into four parts(nanoparticle, natural, robotics, in-vitro), and wrote our own REVIEW JOURNAL PAPER.(Unfortunately not published..) >> [Overview of Drug Delivery Systems _ a weapon against disease [Review].pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19723284/Overview.of.Drug.Delivery.Systems._.a.weapon.against.disease.Review.pdf)

SPARK is now one of the biggest biology clubs among Korean University students.. and I am one of the found members of it.
